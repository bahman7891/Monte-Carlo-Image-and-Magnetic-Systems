# Bayesian Image Reconstruction and Magnetic System Simulation : 
## Monte Carlo Method.

In this project we use Monte Carlo algorithms ( Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Metropolis ) to retrieve images from the noisy data using sampling. Also we use the same methos to calculate the expected magnetization of an easy-plane magnet ( XY model) at various values of interaction and external magetic field strenghts.
